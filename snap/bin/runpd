# PEX_ROOT is the directory where pex will at runtime unpack paradrop and its
# dependencies for execution.  The default is ~/.pex, which is kind of weird
# for a system package.  It is better to tie it to our package version, so that
# we clear out the old code when performing upgrades.

# Hop into Paradrop.  With exec, it inherits the pid, permissions, etc.  that
# this calling script received.
