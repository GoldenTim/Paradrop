# NOTE: This script is not currently being used!
# Snappy does not allow this to be set as a service. Based on the docker code 
# (at the bottom of this file) it expects the script to live on. 
# To fix: have script save pid, uncomment the code below, and write the stop
# script

#can pass arguments along here
bin/pd

# sleep 2
# while [ -e /var/run/pd.pid ]
# do
#     sleep 2
