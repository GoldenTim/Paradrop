Chute Deployment
=============================

Starting with version 0.2, developers should use our website,
`paradrop.org <https://paradrop.org>`_ for creating chutes and installing
them on Paradrop routers.  The command line tools from Paradrop 0.1 are
not currently supported.

As our website is under development, please refer to the instructions
on the website or contact us for help with making and installing a chute.
