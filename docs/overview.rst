Overview
====================================

Paradrop is a software platform that enables developers to create applications (or "chutes") that run on wireless routers. Chutes can be given full control over their router and can monitor traffic, filter traffic, or create their own wireless networks. 

It runs on top of `Ubuntu Snappy <https://developer.ubuntu.com/en/snappy/>`_ , a trimmed-down and secured operating system that can run on ARM and x86. `Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`_ provides encapsulation for chutes through Linux Containers.

To get started developing on (or for!) paradrop, check out :doc:`quickstart`. 

For a descriptive explination of paradrop's build process, see :doc:`build system`.
