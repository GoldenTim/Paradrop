ParaDrop Devices
==================

This section describes various hardware platforms that we support for running ParaDrop.

If this is your first time working with ParaDrop and you do not have
access to any of the supported hardware platforms, we recommend
starting with our pre-built virtual machine image.

With the hardware platform up and running, you are ready to activate the router in ParaDrop.
The page :doc:`../manual/index` gives detailed information about that.
