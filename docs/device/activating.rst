Activating a Router
===================

Follow these steps the first time you start a new physical or virtual
ParaDrop router.  Activation associates the router with your account on
`paradrop.org <https://paradrop.org>`_ so that you can manage the router
and install chutes from the chute store.

1. Make an account on `paradrop.org <https://paradrop.org>`_ if you do not have one.
2. From the Routers tab, click Create Router.  Give your router a unique name and an optional description to help you remember it and click Submit.
3. On the router page, find the "Router ID" and "Password" fields.  You will need to copy this information to the router so that it can connect.
4. Open the router portal at http://<router_address>.  You may be prompted for a username and password.  The default login is "paradrop" with an empty password.
5. Click the "Activate the router with a ParaDrop Router ID" button and enter the information from the paradrop.org router page.  If the activation was successful, you should see checkmarks appear on the "WAMP Router" and "ParaDrop Server" lines.  You may need to refresh the page to see the update.
