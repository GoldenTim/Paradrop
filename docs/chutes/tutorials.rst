Paradrop Chute Tutorials
=============================

This page details out information about advanced chute architecture and installation.
We assume you have already gone through :doc:`gettingstarted`.


Testing on your development computer
-------------------------------------

To keep the development process for Paradrop as simple as possible, we heavily encourage and support developers testing their chutes on a virtual machine.

Wi-Fi in virtual machines

In order to support development on a virtual machine, you most likely need a Wi-Fi device (otherwise it wouldn't be a router would it??).
This is easily supported with Wi-Fi USB adapters.
